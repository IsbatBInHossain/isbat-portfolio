# Matrix themed Backend Engineer Portfolio

This is a responsive, dark-themed portfolio website, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The design is heavily inspired by classic hacker terminals and sci-fi aesthetics like _The Matrix_, featuring CRT effects, a "digital rain" background, and a cinematic boot-up loader sequence.

## Features

- **Thematic Design:** A cohesive "hacker terminal" aesthetic with CRT screen effects, scan lines, and a green-on-black color scheme.
- **Cinematic Loader:** A multi-stage boot-up sequence that simulates a system hack, running only on the user's first visit.
- **Interactive Background:** A subtle grid pattern that lights up with a pulsing "spotlight" effect around the user's cursor.
- **"Decrypting" Project Cards:** Project cards that start as "encrypted" noise and are revealed with a scanning animation as they scroll into view.
- **Fully Responsive:** Designed to look great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Easy to Customize:** All personal data (name, projects, links, etc.) is managed in a single `src/data/config.js` file for easy updates.
